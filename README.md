# Find Your Recipe
This is a web app that finds recipes for **you**, with what **you** have, for the time **you** have, this project was made for a Tradeshow convention through my school, it got my an honorable mention 
(Effectivly second place in the computer science sector). This project is created with react using typescript

## Visit The Page
You can access the web-app [here](https://findurrecipe.vercel.app/) through vercel, which I use to host the web-app

## The API
For the API for this project I use [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/) this is a free API, which I do not use for commercial purposes. This API is what powers this project, how ever it is also the projects greatest weakness since
it has a limited amount of recipes compared to other recipe API's how ever this is the only truly free one that was available.
